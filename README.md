# Etch-a-Sketch
a drawing canvas where you can unleash your creativity.

## [Live Preview][def]
I will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project.

Steps:-
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
    -   Create the divs using JavaScript. 
    -   use CSS Grid to organize the grid

2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color
    when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would.
    
    There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs,
    including:
    -   adding a new class to the div.(The one I use)
    -   changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

3.  Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking
    for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing
    grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space
    as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
    
    -   You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64
        grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.

4. Push the project to GitHub!
